# THESE SAMPLES ARE NOW OLD AND HAVE BEEN MOVED DIRECTLY INTO THE MAIN SHINY REPOSITORY FOR V2

## Shiny Samples

Please note that this is always built against the dev version of Shiny libraries, thus some features may not be available yet on nuget.

Use Samples.sln if you want to build the project.  The -Debug.sln is for testing with the raw source code which requires special setup.

These samples make use of:
* Prism
* ReactiveUI & RX Principles
* Heavy use of dependency injection

If you don't like any of these or you find them "complex" - Shiny is probably not for you.

If you are looking to just use one part of Shiny, such as notifications, this probably isn't for you.  Shiny brings:
* Handles all of the cruft like Permissions, main thread traversal, and app restarts
* Your infrastructure to the background
* Gives a clean & testable API surface for your code

## Compiling on iOS
NFC & Push Notifications are enabled in the info.plist which means you need a custom provisioning profile (or you have to disable these before deploying to your device)
